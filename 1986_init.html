Clint Eastwood, a man who fought with his fists and guns in dozen of movies never considered running for any public office as apart of his life career accomplishments.</p><p>However as a part-time bar restaurant owner downtown, Eastwood understands the problems of the chasm between the residents of Carmel and the business community that appeared to be worsening every day during a time of negative attitude being rampant in the town caused by the council regime at city hall. Though his background as a boy raised up in San Francisco and being called a disgruntled real estate developer by the mayor might be a problem on the campaign trail with Clint, the quiet seaside town of Carmel-by-the-Sea is his home. This is where he chose to live, where his friends live, and where his heart is.</p>",
